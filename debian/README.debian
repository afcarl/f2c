f2c for debian
--------------

This version of f2c automatically converts the header file
f2c.h to not use long ints when compiled on alpha architecture,
as this generates incorrect code for EQUIVALENCEs (64 bit longs
are used on the alpha), and is not compatible with g77.  On
other platforms the file is used as is.   Similar changes
may turn out to be needed on other 64 bit architectures.
